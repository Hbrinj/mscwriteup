\ssctn{Single stepping}
Single stepping allows for a single step in the execution to be carried out.
\itm{
  \item Main window \rarr Single-Step button
  \item Shortcut: F7
  \item \itl{Actions \rarr Single-Step}\\\\
}
\ssctn{Multi stepping}
Multi stepping will take a number of steps as described in the text box or, until the program has no other steps to take.
\itm{
  \item Main window \rarr Multi-Step
  \item Shortcut: F8
  \item \itl{Actions \rarr Multi-Step}\\\\
}
\ssctn{Walking}
Walking will take a number of steps each tick continually.
\itm{
  \item Main window \rarr Timed walk
  \item Shortcut: F9
  \item \itl{Actions \rarr Walk}
}

\ssctn{Breakpoints}
Breakpoint usage can be activated or deactivated via the tick box in the program control, as shown in Figure \ref{fig: debugctrl}.
\sssctn{Simple breakpoints}
Simple breakpoints can be activated in one of two ways.
\num{
  \item \itl{Special \rarr Simple Breakpoints}
  \item Double clicking a line in the memory window
}
This sets the breakpoint for a particular address. If the breakpoint system is active, then when the execution step lands on a breakpoint it will halt execution.
\sssctn{Complex breakpoints}
Complex breakpoints can be set via \itl{Special \rarr Breakpoints}. Complex breakpoints can set specific conditions for the breakpoint to occur. One such usage is to use a single breakpoint for multiple memory addresses by setting the correct mask.

\ssctn{Watchpoints}
Watchpoint usage can be [de]activated via the tick box in the program control, as shown in Figure \ref{fig: debugctrl}
\sssctn{Simple Watchpoints}
Simple watchpoints can be accessed via \itl{Special \rarr Simple Watchpoints}. The Watchpoints allow developers to check memory addresses during a programs execution, watching for changes.

\sssctn{Complex Watchpoints}
Complex watchpoints can be accessed via \itl{Special \rarr Watchpoints}. Much like complex breakpoints, they provide greater control and masking abilities on memory addresses.
