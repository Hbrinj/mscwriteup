\sctn{Background}
KoMoDo is an existing development environment for the assembly-level programming of the 32-bit ARM chip.  It was originally designed by Charlie Brej of the Dept. of Computer Science, University of Manchester. The majority of the current maintenance is handled by Jim Garside â€“ a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester.\\\\

KoMoDo allows for development either at the PC-board level for actual ARM-chip programming or, alternatively, it can offer an emulated environment for the ARM chip using a simulated set-up known as the \itl{Jimulator}.
