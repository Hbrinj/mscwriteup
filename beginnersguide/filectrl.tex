\ssctn{Open}
Two main types of files can be opened in KoMoDo. \func{*.S} source files which need to be compiled and \func{KMD} KoMoDo files that have already been compiled. When choosing the \func{*.S}, KoMoDo will automatically compile and load the \func{KMD} counterpart.

\ssctn{Reload}
The reload button remembers the type and path of the file which was loaded. Once clicked it will reload the remembered file, compiling if needed.
