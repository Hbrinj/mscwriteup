\ssctn{Open}
Two main types of files can be opened in KoMoDo. \itl{*.S} source files which need to be compiled and \itl{KMD} KoMoDo files that have already been compiled. Open will distinguish between the two and compile automatically.
\itm{
  \item \itl{File \rarr open file}
  \item Main window \rarr open \\\\
}

\ssctn{Reload}
Depending on which type of file was loaded initially, the reload button will reload the file and compile it if needed.
\itm{
  \item \itl{File \rarr reload file}
  \item Main window \rarr reload \\\\
}
