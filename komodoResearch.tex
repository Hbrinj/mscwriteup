\sctn{KoMoDo}
KoMoDo utilises additional components to provide capabilities which allow users to emulate the 32-bit ARM chip. It communicates with the various components in different ways. For example communication between the Jimulator and KoMoDo occurs via a two-way Unix pipe in the form of commands defined by the Jimulator. This section aims to explore the communication between these various components and how they are integrated into KoMoDo.
