A great deal of thanks must go to my supervisor Professor David Brailsford. He was instrumental in helping me improve my prose. Additionally, the countless hours he has spent reading my numerous drafts are duly appreciated. Finally, his support when I began running into development issues provided me with the necessary confidence to keep going.\\\\
